        <p class="section-body">
          I am a Project Manager and SSA Solutions & Customer Success Engineer
          with a focus on Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Space Traffic
          Management (STM), and operational mission support. Over the last
          years, I have worked across customer-facing and technical roles,
          combining project management, systems engineering, and business
          development to support commercial and institutional space missions.
        </p>
        <p class="section-body">
          At OKAPI:Orbits, I manage LEOP support services and help deliver
          tailored STM solutions, aligning product development with market
          needs and customer workflows. Previously, I worked as a Space Systems
          Engineer at ConstellR on verification and validation plans, subsystem
          coordination, and requirement flowdown, and completed a Masters
          thesis at The Exploration Company on an MBSE automation framework
          that links requirements databases with engineering data.
        </p>
        <p class="section-body">
          My earlier experience spans mission analysis for a 3U CubeSat,
          SAP customer success and backend support, and systems engineering
          & business development at Valispace, including workshops, use-case
          development, and an IAC 2021 publication on data-driven engineering.
          I am deeply passionate about using space technology to benefit life
          on Earth and building data-driven, scalable processes for future
          missions.
